# Helsinki Trams Arrival Board

Small example Flutter project to show Helsinki real-time tram arrival times.

I live between two stops and don't like waiting in the cold :-)

Currently shows the two stops I live near, edit the query in `/lib/query.dart` to get different stops. You can find stop IDs by finding the stop on https://reittiopas.hsl.fi/ and looking at the URL.
